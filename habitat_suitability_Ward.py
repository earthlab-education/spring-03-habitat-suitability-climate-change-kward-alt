# %% [markdown]
# ## Indiangrass overview 
# I selected **_Sorghastrum nutans_ (Indiangrass)**, a native warm-season perennial bunch grass (i.e., grows in clumps) common in tallgrass and mixed-grass prairie systems across much of the central and eastern contiguous United States. It is typically found in open grasslands, prairie restorations (or land reclaimation projects), fallow farmland, and *especially* where periodic fire limits woody encroachment. There are two sites of interest for this project: Illinois and Kansas. 
# 
# Geographic range is broad in CONUS, but persistence is strongest in intact prairie landscapes. Main pressures that disrupt indiangrass include conversion to agriculture/urban land cover (the primary driver of indiangrass loss), fragmentation (also due to human activity), woody encroachment from fire suppression, and climate-driven loss due to moisture stress. Since moisture stress is important I focus on precipation as my climate variable in this project. 
# 
# ### Benefits of indiangrass
# The loss of indiagrass harms both ecosystem services and native species that rely on it. For example, indiangrass provides substantial ecological value:
# 1. It is used as nesting material and escape cover for grassland birds (Brakie, 2017)
# 2. Their seeds provide additional nutrition for grassland birds (Brakie, 2017)
# 3. It provides grazing for buffalo and for livestock (Brakie, 2017)
# 
# ### The role of fire
# Walker (1991) also notes that fire disturbance is important to the persistence or lacktherof of indiangrass. Fire has historically maintained tallgrass prairie, and indiangrass is repeatedly characterized as fire tolerant through postfire sprouting from rhizomes. Walker (1991) also notes controlled burns (particularly late spring burns in many tallgrass systems) have been observed to support the proliferation of the species. In restoration and conservation practice, indiangrass is widely used for prairie reconstruction, conservation cover, and erosion control from wind and rain. It is typically planted in mixtures with other warm-season grasses to rebuild tallgrass habitats (Brakie, 2017).
# 
# ### Key traits and characteristics 
# **Key traits** [Brakie, 2017; USDA, n.d.]
# - Trait:	            [Indiangrass typical range / value]
# - Height (culms):	    [~1–2.5 m (3–8 ft)]
# - Leaf blade width:	    [~5–10 mm (to ~12 mm reported in some materials)]
# - Flowering window:	    [Mid‑summer to fall; often ~Jul–Oct across the range (earlier north, later south)]
# - Seed mass:	        [~1.9–2.0 g per 1,000 seeds (≈1.9–2.0 mg per seed; method-dependent)]
# - Season:      	        [C4 (warm-season)]
# - Lifespan:	            [Perennial; productive seed stands commonly reported ~10–15 years under managed production]
# - pH range:             [4.8-8.0] 
# - Precipitation:        [11-45 inches]
# - Root depth:           [24 inches minimum] 
# - Salinity toleranace:  [Medium] 
# - Shade tolerance:      [High]
# 
# *Note*: there are also cultivars of Indiangrass that have different traits, but for the purpose of this project I am just referring to the primary species in the PLANTS database. 
# 
# ### The project
# 
# To evaluate habitat suitability, I use:
# - **Soil pH (POLARIS, 60-100 cm)** as an edaphic control. I use 60-100cm due to the root depth of Indiangrass. 
# - **Slope (derived from SRTM)** as a topographic constraint (flatter prairie landscapes are generally more suitable). However the two sites I review in this project are both mostly flat to hilly (Kansas and Illinois). 
# - **Annual precipitation climate normal (MACAv2)** as the primary climate driver for this C4 grass. Since the plant is sensitive to precipitation I thought this would be a somewhat good substitution for the lack of fire regime data in the model. 
# 
# Core question: **How does projected mid-century climate change (relative to a historical baseline) alter suitable habitat for _S. nutans_ across contrasting prairie-region sites in CONUS [Kansas v. Illinois], and how sensitive are results to climate-model uncertainty?**
# 
# Sites: 
# - Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Kansas [referred to as Tallgrass in the notebook]
# - Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois [referred to as Midewin in the notebook]
# - I wanted to see how sensitive northern colonies of indiangrass were to climate change after I learned that indiangrass is pretty much everywhere in the U.S. except for far western states (California, Washington, etc.)

# ### Step 1b: Load official site boundaries
# &
# ### Step 1c: Build buffered processing boundaries
# 
# ### Boundarygate
# I had a lot of issues with boundaries for these two sites. When I originally completed this, I had done a "center" plot where I took the center lat/lon of each site and made a simple plot. The reason I did this is because between "official" sources, the preserves own trail maps, and other map sources, such as google earth and google maps, there is not a clear consensus on the extent of the two sites. Some sources I found were administrative boundaries which aligned with *land ownership* but not the actual extent of the site.
# 
# I was really dissatisfied when I got to my results and decided to redo this. What this means in practice is I had to either, delete and start over, or create some backwards compatibility going forwards. I chose the latter.
# 
# #### Whats new
# 
# So as stated, in earlier iterations, sites were represented using a central coordinate and a fixed buffer. While useful for initial exploration, that approach did not accurately reflect the spatial extent or shape of each preserve. In particular, it could misrepresent the data I was plotting (i.e., viewer thinks the preserve is larger than it is), land cover heterogeneity, and the true area extent.
# 
# To improve spatial accuracy, I now pull boundaries from "authoritative" sources:
# 
# - Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie (Illinois): U.S. Forest Service Administrative Forest Boundaries
# - Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve (Kansas): National Park Service tract and boundary dataset
# 
# These boundaries are then standardized and used as the basis for all subsequent clipping and analysis.
# 
# To maintain compatibility with earlier cells in the notebook, some variable names (e.g., sites_gdf) are retained even though they now represent polygon boundaries rather than point locations.
# 
# **Important note on boundary uncertainty:**
# Even these “official” datasets are not perfect representations of the preserves. For example, the USFS administrative boundary for Midewin reflects organizational units rather than strictly ecological or managed prairie areas.
# 
# As a result, the boundaries used here should be understood as the best available approximation for regional-scale analysis rather than exact delineations of preserve extent.

# ## Site descriptions [**Reflect and Respond**]

# %% [markdown]
# I selected two prairie-focused sites in different parts of the species range:
# 
# **The Last "Stand" or the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Kansas** 
# 
# The National Park Service notes that "tallgrass prairie once covered 170 million acres of North America...[but] today less than 4% remains intact, mostly in the Kansas Flint Hills." [National Park Service, n.d.; National Preserve Kansas]
# 
# As such the Flint Hills tallgrass landscape has a relatively intact prairie and strong fire-grazing ecological dynamics. This site makes for good comparison to Illinois where that has been mostly a restoration project not a conservation project. 
# 
# We can also see in the Kansas map that the surrounding area is also unfragmented and not interrupted by other land cover, namely built environments. 
# 
# **From Munitions to Grass? The Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, Illinois** 
# 
# The Illinois site is a large restoration project. As noted by the U.S. Forestry Service (n.d.), the site "[Turns] back the clock from a landscape dominated by rusting munitions factories and abandoned ammunitions bunkers into a 20,283-acre pristine tallgrass prairie." They go one to embellish that this, "makes the Midewin a compelling vision for landscape scale restoration."
# 
# Of course, we know that this site is not *pristine* especially if it was previously a significantly disturbed site by a *different* form of *"fire."* 
# 
# Noteably, the Illinois site is very different from the Kansas site. The area around Midewin are very developed and there is a lot of fragmentation.
# 
# **Expected suitability**
# 
# I expect both sites to remain at least mostly suitable because _S. nutans_ is broadly distributed across the U.S., and based on its traits, seems to establish itself well as long as woody invasives are managed. Similarly, both sites are (seemingly) cared for due to the threatened status of indiangrass. However, I do expect **greater climate-model spread** in projected suitability at Midewin (IL) because it is a more fragmented site, and may be more sensitive to precipitation-seasonality shifts. Tallgrass (KS) should remain comparatively strong since this habitat has been preserved and not disturbed by ammunition.
# 
# **I think the main driver is not actually climate change for the Midewin site but what urban development is going on around it that may impact suitability. For example, pH changes, salinity, etc** Of course, there is no way to fuzzy map that, but it is a covariate that I can't account for.

# ### Step 1c: Select time periods
# 
# For my climate normals, I used 1981-2010 and 2041-2070. I had to use a different link to acces the data as my download kept crashing my kernel. As a result my "historical" range is shifted forward by 5 years due to the data used but I don't expect this to drastically affect the modeling output. 
# 
# ## Picking two time periods [**Reflect and Respond**]
# 
# - **Historical baseline: 1981-2010** (MACAv2 historical scenario)
# - **Mid-century future: 2041-2070** (MACAv2 RCP8.5 scenario)
# 
# This pair should provide a good baseline and future modeling comparison. However, the two sites should likely be modeled with their own independent set of time periods (even though that doesn't allow for comparison then). I say this because the Tallgrass (KS) site was established in 1996 and has been preserved for 30 years now so the habitat is more stable. In comparison the Midewin (IL) site was "established" in 1996, but due to the reclamation process, was not actually finished until 2004. That is almost a decade of difference between the two sites in terms of establishment. 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Step 1d: Select climate models [**Reflect and Respond**]
# 
# ### Climate models used
# This analysis uses four global climate models (GCMs). These models simulate future climate under the RCP8.5 emissions scenario and are commonly used to capture uncertainty across different climate projections.
# 
# Models Used:
# 
# 1. CanESM2 (Canada) [best fit for warm & wet]
# 
# - Developed by: Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis
# - Type: Earth system model (includes carbon cycle feedbacks)
# - General traits:
#     - Often shows warmer and wetter futures
#     - Can "produce" strong vegetation and ecosystem responses
#     - Why included:
#         - Represents a higher-sensitivity climate response
#         - Because I am using precipitation and soil ph this model may provide a good assessment for Indiangrass (can handle dry and wet years)
# 
# 2. CNRM-CM5 (France) [best fit for more "moderate" conditions]
# 
# - Developed by: Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques
# - Type: Coupled atmosphere–ocean model
# - General traits:
#     - Typically produces moderate warming signals
#     - Often considered middle-of-the-road among CMIP5 models
#     - Why included:
#         - Serves as a baseline / moderate scenario
#         - Since Indiangrass is established across much of the U.S. a more "intermediate" scenario could suit it better since it seems to thrive pretty much anywhere that it gets established (and not crowded out by woody species)
# 
# 3. HadGEM2-ES (United Kingdom) [best fit for warm & dry]
# 
# - Developed by: Met Office Hadley Centre
# - Type: Earth system model (includes atmospheric chemistry + carbon cycle)
# - General traits:
#     - Often projects strong warming and drying in some regions
#     - Captures complex land–atmosphere interactions
#         - Why included:
#             - Represents perhaps the most *reasonable* model for the two sites in the future, as both Kansas and Illinois are getting warmer but not wetter (CanESM2)
# 
# 4. inmcm4 (Russia) [best for counterfactual cooler & dry]
# 
# - Developed by: Institute of Numerical Mathematics
# - Type: Coupled climate model
# - General traits:
#     - Often shows lower climate sensitivity
#     - Produces more conservative (muted) changes
#     - Why included:
#         - Provides a more conservative projection
#         - Thought it would provide an interesting contrast to the other models since Indiangrass does not have a high cold tolerance

# ## STEP 2: Data access
# 
# ### Step 2a: Soil data
# 
# I pulled the soil data from the [POLARIS dataset](http://hydrology.cee.duke.edu/POLARIS/) based on the PLANTS database criteria I specified earlier in the indiangrass introduction. Since the minimum depth of roots for indiangrass is 24 inches, I am using the 60 to 100 cm depth in POLARIS. 24 inches is approximately 60 cm and since it is the minimum, the 60cm to 100cm depth is most suitable.

# ### Step 2c: Climate model data

# %% [markdown]
# ## Debugging note
# 
# I do not have dask in this environment so I installed it in terminal. If you also do not have it run the following in terminal: 
# 
# - conda activate [your environment]
# - conda install -c conda-forge dask
# 
# Dask is helpful for data scaling with limited memory. The documentation states: Dask processes datasets larger than memory (out-of-memory) by operating on chunks, allowing dask.dataframe to handle massive tabular data and dask.array to handle large-scale numerical data.
# 
# After the 3rd iteration of this cell, I got a DAP error so there is a timeout happening. So now I will open URLs one at a time and subsetting immediately. I had to import time for this.

# I used MACAv2-METDATA daily downscaled climate projections to characterize precipitation (pr) and computed 30-year climate normals by averaging annual precipitation totals over each target period. MACAv2 provides statistically downscaled climate data at ~4 km resolution, derived from CMIP5 global climate models and bias-corrected using historical observations.
# 
# Dataset setup:
# 
# - Historical baseline: 1981–2010 (historical)
# - Future projection: 2041–2070 (rcp85)
# - Variable: precipitation (pr) aggregated to annual totals and averaged to create climate normals
# 
# I selected four CMIP5 models (CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES365, inmcm4) to capture a range of projected hydroclimate conditions. These models represent different precipitation sensitivities and regional responses, allowing for a more robust assessment of uncertainty in future climate conditions. Model selection was informed by the MACAv2 archive and Climate Toolbox resources.

# ### Quick data analysis
# 
# *Midewin (IL)*
# - Historical to Future Mean HSI: 0.866 → 0.824
#     - So between time periods a little bit of a drop.
# - Suitable area: 47% → 47% 
#     - Really did not change much at all.
# 
# *Tallgrass (KS)*
# - Historical to Future Mean HSI: 0.836 → 0.833 
#     - These are so similar I reran my code but this is the correct output. Very little change in Kansas.
# - Suitable area: 45% → 45%
#     - Seemingly no climate change effects for the Kansas Preserve 
# 
# It is important to note that this is the suitability within the bounds of the preserve. It does not mean that indiangrass is not more suitable in other areas of Kansas or Illinois. The HSI is stable over time, and roughly 50% of each site remains a good fit for the species. **Importantly the habitat quality (HSI) stays stable over time**.
# 
# What is interesting is that under climate change we would expect northern sites to do better, but Illinois fair *marginally* worse than Kansas. Kansas may just be in the south-north range sweet spot for indiangrass even under projected precipitation stress. 

# %% [markdown]
# ### Quick interpretation
# 
# When I first did this ananlysis I had a much higher suitable area percentage but that is because the calculations were not fitted to the explicit preserve boundaries. I do not have that old analysis here, but the original suitability was in the 80% range. So it seems my updates to the boundaries have made these models more accurate for the individual sites instead of the site + surrounding area. 
# 
# As a result, the updated suitability results differ from earlier iterations due to improved spatial representation of study sites. Replacing my point-based buffers with official boundary polygons alters the set of pixels included in analysis and reduces geometric bias I had before. As a result, suitability estimates are more stable and likely better reflect underlying environmental conditions.

# ### Key takeaway
# 
# Climate change produces *very* modest declines in habitat quality (HSI) while the overall extent of suitable habitat remains largely stable across both sites. Differences between sites persist, but are less pronounced than in earlier model runs (re:boundarygate). Tallgrass Prairie (KS) remains highly stable, while Midewin (IL) shows *slightly* greater sensitivity to future conditions.
# 
# ### Larger analysis
# 
# Across both sites, the fuzzy model indicates that habitat suitability for *_Sorghastrum nutans_* remains consistently high under both historical (1981–2010) and future (2041–2070) climate conditions (precipitation). Mean habitat suitability values are slightly higher under historical conditions and decline modestly in future projections, particularly at the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie site.
# 
# At Midewin, mean HSI decreases from approximately 0.87 to 0.82, indicating a measurable reduction in overall habitat quality. However, the percentage of area classified as suitable remains nearly unchanged (~47%), suggesting that while conditions become somewhat less optimal, most of the landscape remains above the suitability threshold. This pattern indicates a within-class decline in suitability, rather than a large-scale loss of suitable habitat.
# 
# In contrast, the Tallgrass Prairie site shows minimal change between historical and future conditions. Mean HSI values remain nearly constant (~0.84), and suitable area also remains stable (~45%). This suggests that Tallgrass Prairie is relatively robust to projected mid-century climate changes, at least under the variables included in this model.
# 
# Compared to earlier iterations of this analysis (re:boundarygate), differences across climate models are less pronounced. This reflects improvements in spatial processing, including the use of official site boundaries and more consistent raster alignment. As a result, I believe the updated outputs provide a more stable and realistic estimate of habitat suitability.
# 
# #### Quanitfying change over time due to model differences
# 
# Although earlier runs suggested strong model disagreement—particularly at the Midewin site—the updated results indicate more consistent outcomes across models. Rather than large divergences, the primary pattern is a modest decline in mean suitability at Midewin and near-complete stability at Tallgrass.
# 
# This suggests that projected climate impacts on *_Sorghastrum nutans_* habitat are relatively subtle at the spatial scale of this analysis. The results emphasize that changes in habitat quality may occur without large changes in total suitable area.
# 
# For example in the pivot table, examining model-specific changes in habitat suitability reveals that the CanESM2 model (warm + wet projection) produces the largest declines in HSI at both sites. *This is expected* since my climate variable was precipitation. In contrast, the HadGEM2 model (often characterized as warmer and drier) shows little to no change in suitability.
# 
# I first thought that drier conditions should to reduce habitat suitability more strongly. However, I have to think how the model thinks, so this pattern reflects the structure of the fuzzy model, which is primarily driven by precipitation rather than temperature. In this framework, increases in precipitation beyond the optimal range can reduce suitability just as much as decreases below it. As a result, the “warm + wet” scenario produces larger declines because it pushes conditions outside the modeled optimal precipitation window, whereas the “warm + dry” scenario may still fall within acceptable bounds even if we know the US will experience warming. 
# 
# #### Limitations
# I used a compact fuzzy rule set (soil pH, slope, precipitation) and did not include disturbance regime (e.g., fire/grazing), land use, or dispersal constraints, so the maps represent only potential climatic suitability.
# 
# Additionally, while official administrative boundaries were used to improve spatial accuracy, these boundaries do not perfectly correspond to ecological prairie extent. Therefore, the results and plots I have should be interpreted as approximate representations of site-level suitability rather than precise delineations of habitat.
# 
# #### More grass digging--Why is the grass not *greener* on the other *site*
# 
# The biggest limitation, based on the literature, is actually the inability of my fuzzy model to capture fire ecology. As mentioned in the introduction at the beginning of this notebook, fire suppression may negative effect indiangrass because it allows intrusion by woody species. This is important because as Walker (1991) states, "The maintenance of the tallgrass prairie before European settlement was largely due to the occurrence of fire.  In the absence of fire, invasion by woody species is common [12].  Without periodic fires Indiangrass declines in terms of reproductive effort and relative cover [32]. Indiangrass survives fire by sprouting from on-site surviving rhizomes." (*FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS*). 
# 
# Because fire regime is not included in my model, these results reflect climatic suitability only and may underestimate the importance of disturbance processes in maintaining high-quality habitat. This would be important to model because Walker (1991) makes it clear that fire is good for this species and can rebound quickly depending on the season. Noteably annual burns are important. I am including the excerpt from the section *PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE*
# 
#     Indiangrass density and apparent vigor [17,22], number of flowering
#     culms [9,38,45], and percent canopy and basal cover [5,57] increase with
#     late spring burning conducted prior to green-up.  Burning during other
#     seasons may increase flowering stems [38] or decrease percent
#     composition of Indiangrass [72].  The greatest increase in canopy cover,
#     density, production, and flowering occurs following annual burns
#     [2,25,44,45].  Seeds are generally absent in burned soils, and most
#     reproduction following fire is vegetative [2].  Fire intensity affects
#     short-term rhizome reproduction.  Late summer fires (September 5th) were
#     conducted with both high-intensity and low-intensity fuels.  Little or
#     no damage occurred on the low-intensity fuel area, but tiller densities
#     were reduced on the high-intensity fuel area.  However, tiller density
#     returned to normal by the following August. (Walker, 1991).
# 
# It would be interesting to model the affects of changing fire regimes, especially as humans try to tamp down on fires as much as possible. **My hypothesis is that: Kansas is less densely populated than Illinois, which may allow for more frequent use of prescribed fire and fewer constraints on fire management. In contrast, more developed landscapes in Illinois may limit the use of fire as a management tool, potentially influencing habitat conditions for fire-dependent species.** If we look at the site plots from early with the topo basemaps, the Illinois site is encircled by built environments, so I imagine the likelihood of prescribed burns is very low compared to Kansas.
